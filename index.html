    <h1>Welcome to Oliver Wolyniec's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>This is the page for my final project in Yale's "Introduction to Python for Global Affairs", in which I investigated hate narratives propagated by Ilham Aliyev and Nikol Pashinyan, the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia, respectively, in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict from 2020 to 2023.</p>
